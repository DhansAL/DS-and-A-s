# GOAL

- To implement and learn different data structures and algorithms in Typescript and Go.
- To get better at algorithms maybe?

### WHY TYPESCRIPT?

cuz its easier than js.

### WHY DENO?

Goodbye to .tsconfig and no builds required. (RIP ts-node-dev :D)

#### NOTE FOR DENO
 refer - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65115527/how-can-i-avoid-the-an-import-path-cannot-end-with-ts-extension-error-in-vsco](this) for vs-code deno extension config. This avoids error thrown by vs code while importing .ts modules.


# FILE STRUCTURE - wip

Custom implemented Data structures will be kept at `/utils`.

Topic wise questions and thier solutions can be found in
`/DataStructures/**/*` .

For Algorithms - `/Algorithms`.

All the questions will be exported as executable functions. each question will be executed in `/exec/<topicname>`.

Files will be named as `questionNumber` which can be crosschecked by Marklist

## COMMIT KEY

```
  <topicName>-<questionNumber> state
```

where state = `Fresh | revise | ready`

all first executions are `Fresh` by default.

## QUESTION-SOLUTION STRUCTURE

Each question will be solved in format of

- /\*\* Question - source (leetcode/gfg/etc) \*/
- Bruteforce solution
- better solution (s)

Each question will be having a doodle in `/doodles/*`
